## Task 1 â€“ Online Reservation System

This application allows users to book and manage transportation reservations online.

### Features:
- User registration and login
- Reserve a ticket from point A to point B
- Automatic generation of a PNR number
- Manage reservations using the PNR (view or cancel)

### Technologies Used:
- Java EE  
- Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)  
- Java Persistence API (JPA)  
- JSP and Servlets  
- JDBC  
- GlassFish Server

### Architecture:
- Follows MVC principles
- EJB Module handles business logic and transactions
- Web (WAR) Module provides JSP-based UI and Servlet controllers

## Task 2 â€“ Number Guessing Game

A command-line number guessing game written in Java.

### How it works:
- The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100
- User has 6 attempts to guess the correct number
- Feedback is given after each attempt (too high / too low / correct)
- 10 points awarded for a correct guess
- User can play multiple rounds or exit after each game

### Technologies Used:
- Core Java  
- Random number generation  
- Input handling with Scanner  
- Loops and conditionals

## Task 3 â€“ ATM Web Application

A web-based ATM simulation where users can manage their banking actions.

### Features:
- User login with account credentials
- View current account balance
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Transfer funds to another valid account
- Full transaction history with timestamps

### Technologies Used:
- Java EE  
- Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)  
- Java Persistence API (JPA)  
- JSP and Servlets  
- JDBC  
- GlassFish Server

### Architecture:
- EJB Module: business logic, transaction processing, database interaction
- Web (WAR) Module: JSP UI and Servlet-based controllers
- Clean MVC pattern

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to **Oasis Infobyte** and **AICTE** for the opportunity to build practical, real-world Java applications. Each task helped me sharpen my backend development skills using Java EE, EJBs, and JPA while building, debugging, and improving actual working systems.
